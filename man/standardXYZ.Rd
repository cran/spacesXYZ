\title{Query the Standardized XYZ and xy values of Standard Illuminants and Whitepoints}
\alias{standardXYZ}
\alias{standardxy}

\description{
In careful calcuations with standard illuminants and whitepoints,
it is often helpful to have the 'official' values of XYZ and xy,
i.e. with the right number of decimal places.

}

\usage{
standardXYZ( name )

standardxy( name )
}

\arguments{
\item{name}{a subvector of
\code{c('A','B','C','C.NBS','C.NTSC','C.JOSA','D50','D50.ICC',}\cr
\code{'D55','D60','D60.ACES','D65','D75','E','F2','F7','F11')}, 
which are the names of some standard illuminants and white points.
Matching is partial and case-insensitive.
}
}

\details{
All XYZ values are taken from the ASTM publication in \bold{References},
except \code{B} which is taken from \cite{Wyszecki & Stiles}
and \code{D50.ICC} which is taken from ICC publications.

xy values were taken from \cite{CIE}, \cite{BT.709}, and \cite{TB-2018-001}.
For D65 the values in \cite{CIE} and \cite{BT.709} disagree;
the former has 5 digits and the latter has 4.
We have selected the value in \cite{BT.709} (page 3) since is far more commonly used.
Three of the Illuminant C variants are rarely used and obsolete.
}

\section{Warning}{
The returned XYZs are normalized so that Y=1.
In other color domains, it is common to normalize so that Y=100;
in these cases be sure to multiply by 100.

Some illuminants have no XYZ available and some have no xy.
In these cases, the rows are filled with NAs.
}

\value{
\code{standardXYZ()} returns
an Mx3 matrix where M is the length of \code{name}.  
Each row filled with the official XYZ, but if the illuminant name is not recognized
or if there is no data, the row is all \code{NA}s.
The output XYZ is normalized so that \code{Y=1}.
The matrix \code{rownames} are set to the full illuminant names, and \code{colnames} to \code{c('X','Y','Z')}.

Similarly, \code{standardxy()} returns an Mx2 matrix 
with \code{colnames} set to \code{c('x','y')}.
